HealthMonitoringSystem AI/ML
Summary of the Proposed Research

The proposed research aims to develop an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system that can effectively monitor and analyse the health of astronauts exposed to the unique and extreme conditions of space. This system should take into consideration the effects of radiation exposure levels, prolonged isolation periods during the mission, loss of communication due to increase in distance from earth, gravity fields (microgravity), and hostile/closed environments. The Al model will be trained to identify potential health risks in real-time, predict long-term effects, and suggest preventive measures as well.
The proposed system should monitor radiation exposure levels and predict the cumulative impact on astronaut health. The model should assess potential radiation-induced conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological damage. The proposed system should have the capability to analyse psychological and physiological data to identify the effects of long-term isolation and confinement on mental health. It should monitor stress levels, sleep patterns, and cognitive functions to prevent potential issues like depression and anxiety.
The proposed system should evaluate the effects of the increasing distance from Earth on astronaut health, particularly in terms of separation, medical emergencies, and psychological stress. The model will simulate scenarios to provide rapid decision-making support in case of emergencies. The proposed system should monitor the impact of microgravity on muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and other physiological changes. It should predict the long-term consequences of microgravity on overall health and suggest countermeasures such as exercise routines and nutritional plans. The proposed system should assess the impact of living in a closed environment on physical and mental health, focusing on air quality, life support systems, and interpersonal dynamics. The Al model should provide early warnings for any degradation in environmental conditions or group dynamics.

Scope of the Work:
Utilize machine learning models trained on historical data and simulations to forecast radiation levels and their biological impact, integrating data from spacecraft sensors and personal dosimeters Implement Pose and sentiment analysis, coupled with physiological data analysis to identify potential mental health issues.
Develop Al models that simulate Earth-based medical expertise, enabling real-time diagnostics and treatment recommendations based on current health data from astronauts.
Analyse physiological data through Al models to detect early signs of muscle and bone degradation, recommending personalized countermeasures like exercise regimens or pharmacological interventions
